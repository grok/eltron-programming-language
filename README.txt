# Description:
# Eltron Programming Language (EPL and EPL2) is a printer control language used to produce printed paper
# labels for various Eltron (now Zebra) model printers. Newer printers support also the Zebra Programming
# Language (ZPL).
# EPL2 is a markup, line-at-a-time language, suitable for printing on media of reduced space, and although
# it supports bitmaps (and therefore, arbitrary images), its use is usually for labels including barcode
# information. Contrary to what the official documentation title says, it is not a programming language
# (no flow-control or even conditionals are supported; variables are supported as numbered content)
# Each EPL2 line starts with one or more letter (indicating the command), an may be followed by one or
# more comma-separated arguments. Commands and arguments are case-sensitive.
# Arguments that are numeric or belong to a fixed set of options are inlined, and any string or set of
# variable values must be surrounded by double-quotes.
